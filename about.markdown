I am Phillip Paine, PhD a data scientist and applied statistician specialising in time series analysis. This blog explores topics I find interesting in applied statistics, often in sports modelling and finance, particularly at the intersection of statistics, data analysis and programming. I try to combine traditional statistical theory with modern applications in machine learning and generative AI.
