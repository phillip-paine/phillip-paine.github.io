**Alloy.ai**
Data Scientist - Forecasting (May 2022 - Current)

Primarily responsible for improving and maintaining end-to-end forecasting engine in continuous-integration environment and developing the team roadmap in coordination with Managers, Product, Marketing and Sales teams. 

- **Increased demand forecast accuracy** over 10\% by industry-standard metrics using traditional time series methods and modern machine learning techniques across the forecasting pipeline in a continuous-integration environment. 
- **Designed and implemented testing framework** for evaluating proposed forecast engine improvements and enable faster iterations on vendor forecast backtesting for use by customer support and sales teams
- **Successfully contributed to forecast roadmap vision** through creating long-term objectives, and developing the short-term projects, in coordination with Product, Sales and C-suite personnel with the aim of simplifying the offering to deliver forecast improvements 

**BCAA**
Data Scientist - Underwriting Analytics (May 2022 - Apr 2022)
Senior Data Analyst - Underwriting Analytics (May 2019 - May 2020)

Main duties include developing best-in-class insurance pricing models, creating BI tools for use by C-suite, Marketing and Finance teams and providing statistical analysis for marketing campaigns across the insurance product.

- **Established end-to-end data pipeline across insurance products** increasing the visibility of business information across multiple teams including C-suite. Leveraged PySpark, AWS Glue and PowerBI to create a reliable BI framework across the organisation.
- **Implemented early detection of large insurance claim clusters** to create awareness of potential extreme event risks, using a pre-trained word-embedding with CNN models implemented in Tensorflow to predict insurance claim outcomes from early customer conversation transcripts
- **Improved assessment of residential insurance risk leading to more competitive pricing structure** through more accurate prediction of policy counts using ARIMA time series models and of policy costs using ML algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbour and GBMs. Shiny dashboards created in R to demonstrate business value of proposed changes to exec. finance team. 

**University of Sheffield**
Statistical Consultant (Sept 2016 - Dec 2018)

Statistical consultant working with external research institutes to provide statistical analysis, reports on best practices and advanced courses for customers. 

**Bayesian Analysis of Clonogenic Survival Assay Data**
Created a dose-response curve with uncertainty contours from data on the irradiation of cancer cells in Python and R. A Bayesian hierarchical model was used to create a heat map around the dose-response mean curve quantifying the level of uncertainty for multiple sources of error. The outcome was a paper published in the Journal of Radiotherapy and Oncology.

**University of Nottingham**
Post-doctoral Research Fellow - Applied Statistics (Sept 2014 - Sept 2016)

The purpose of the grant was to develop novel regression methods for manifold-valued data and landmark data. Applications of the work includes predicting weather patterns and modelling vector-cardiogram signals.
